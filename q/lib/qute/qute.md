# ðŸ§¸ qute _(q unit tests)_
Unit testing framework in q/kdb

## ðŸš€ Usage
To use qute, simply load the library:
```q
q).lib.require`qute / Loads the qute library
```
### Test files
Tests should be written in a (delimiter-separated values) `dsv` file
- File name should be in the following format: `qute.*.dsv`
- Default delimiter is a pipe (`|`) which can be updated in `.qute.delim`
```dsv
action | minver | code | repeat | ms | bytes | comment
```
